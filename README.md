Kuwana Protocol: Core Architecture & Pooled-Revenue Model(Pre-seed Prototype for Avalanche Team1 Grant)This document outlines the core technical architecture and strategic model for Kuwana Protocol, a decentralized infrastructure platform for tokenizing Real-World Assets (RWAs) in emerging markets.We are building on Avalanche specifically to leverage Subnets for our Enterprise/GovTech vertical. This sovereign, high-throughput environment is essential for providing the immutable, on-chain supply chain verification that our government partners require.1. Core Problem SolvedFor Crypto Investors: Lack of access to stable, non-correlated, de-risked real-world yield.For Emerging Markets: A $50B+ "capital drain" in Nigeria alone (a symptom of a global problem) because local investors are locked out of their own productive, wealth-creating assets.The Technical Problem: The "oracle problem" for business revenue. We solve this with a hybrid, multi-sig "Proof of Revenue" oracle that can aggregate data from multiple off-chain sources (e.g., 10 POS systems) into a single, on-chain profit-split transaction.2. Technical Architecture: Pooled-Revenue ModelOur core innovation is a de-risked, pooled-revenue model. This is our key technical and financial differentiator.1-to-1 Model (Weak): 1 NFT = 1 Kiosk. If that kiosk fails, the investor loses.Pooled Model (Strong): 1 NFT = 1 share of a pool (e.g., 10 kiosks). If 1 kiosk is down for maintenance, investors earn from the other 9.This model is executed by a suite of smart contracts:KuwanaAssetNFT Contract (ERC-721): Mints unique tokens representing a fractionalized share in a pool of productive assets (e.g., the "Jollof Spot Pilot Pool 1," which contains 10 kiosks).KuwanaDistributor Contract: The immutable 50/40/10 smart contract. This contract is the heart of the protocol. It is designed to:Receive multiple data feeds from our oracle (one profit report from each of the 10 kiosks).Aggregate this revenue into a single, on-chain pool.Execute the transparent 50/40/10 profit split to all NFT holders, the Op-Co, and the DAO.KuwanaMarketplace Contract: A dedicated secondary market for the P2P trading of Kuwana RWA-NFTs.KuwanaDAO Contract: Governs the 10% Protocol Treasury, allowing $KUWANA holders to vote on new verticals, R&D grants, and platform upgrades.3. The Kuwana Verification Oracle: Our "Truth" LayerBridging off-chain revenue data securely is the most critical component. We use a hybrid oracle architecture:Custom Revenue Oracle: Real-world POS systems (like Yoco or Square) from each asset push a verified "end-of-day" sales report to a secure API.Multi-Sig Validation: This data is then validated by a multi-signature (3-of-5) committee (e.g., Kuwana Op-Co, an external auditor, a DAO-elected validator).Proof of Revenue: The validated sales report hashes are published to IPFS, and the on-chain transactions are sent to the KuwanaDistributor contract. This creates an immutable, publicly auditable "proof of revenue."Chainlink Price Feeds: The protocol uses Chainlink to pull real-time price data (e.g., USDC/ZAR) to ensure all profit calculations and distributions are accurate.4. Why Avalanche?We are building on Avalanche due to specific technical and strategic advantages essential for our RWA model:Sub-Second Finality & Low Fees: Our protocol's core function is the daily pooled micro-distribution of profits to thousands of NFT holders. Avalanche's speed and sub-cent fees make these real-time payouts economically viable.Subnet Capability: The "Ethical Commodities" GovTech vertical requires a dedicated, high-throughput environment for supply chain verification. An Avalanche Subnet provides the ideal solution, offering a sovereign, scalable chain for our enterprise and government partners.EVM Compatibility: Leverages the robust, battle-tested security of the EVM environment and streamlines development.RWA & Institutional Focus: The Avalanche Foundation's clear strategic emphasis on tokenizing real-world assets aligns perfectly with Kuwana's mission.5. Security & GovernanceSecurity: The protocol is secured by professional audits (e.g., CertiK), 4-of-7 multi-sig controls for all critical functions, 72-hour timelocks for any parameter changes, and automatic "circuit breakers" on the KuwanaDistributor contract to pause distributions in case of an anomaly.Governance: We will use a progressive decentralization model, moving from a Foundation-led pilot (Stage 1) to a fully decentralized DAO (Stage 3) that controls the protocol and its treasury.6. Jollof Spot Pilot: Financial ModelThis model funds the entire 10-kiosk pilot.MetricValueKiosks in Pilot Pool10Total Capex (10 * $35k)~$350,000Total Asset Token Value$1,440,000Fractions per Pool (NFTs)1,000Price per 0.1% NFT Stake$1,440Projected Investor Yield20-25% APYThe ~$1.09M premium (Total Value - Total Capex) is retained by the Kuwana Op-Co to fund 18 months of operational runway, working capital, legal/smart contract audits, and marketing for the entire 10-kiosk pilot.
